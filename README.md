# What will Ember do?
It will contain about 400 games, mainly in folders, though some will be from extensions.
Extensions will be .ZIP files. They will have to be extracted and moved into the Ember-ESM folder.
Ember will also contain a page to access the Node Unblocker run through a Pi 5, and possibly be able to use SSH to access certain other games, such as Urban Terror, AssualtCube, and Red Eclipse.
Ember is the second main release, expected to be finished around February 25th.
